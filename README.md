# Node.js Mentorship Program

### Why I would like to join the mentorship team ?

Back when I started development with Javascript, I heard about Node.js and how I can use to develop back-end server. So I started learning and was amazed by the capabilities of Node.js. Node.js continues to grow and many bigger companies are now transitioning to Node.js. Even with the help of Node.js now creating desktop application is very easy and many of my day-to-day applications like VSCode, Slack, Skype, Atom is built on top of Electron which is based on Node.js. With the help of Node.js and various javascript frameworks like React today I am a full stack engineer.

I always admire open source projects and the way it helps in the development of many projects. I always wanted to contribute to an open source project, but have been always confused from where to start. This is perfect opportunity for me to learn from the best leaders/engineers and give back to the community.
